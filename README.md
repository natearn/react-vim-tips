# react-vim-tips
A simple example of reusable react components

## My Objectives
- Experiment with React project organization and delivery
- Write something against an open REST API
- Demonstrate my understanding of the React framework on Github

## Usage
You can load the component as external [JavaScript](https://natearn.github.io/react-vim-tips/dist/VimTips.js) and [CSS](https://natearn.github.io/react-vim-tips/stylesheets/VimTips.css) files right now, as I've done on [this site](http://natearn.info). Ideally, you would install the library and add the component to your React project, but I don't _actually_ expect anyone to want to use this.
